I've been working pretty much flat out since my year of internship kicked off at the start of September and the work has already taken its toll on me emotionally and physically.

Fortunately, today marks the start of a two week break in which I can recover and relax. I've booked a few appointments in with friends and family but for the most part I'm planning on spending a relatively solitary holiday.
