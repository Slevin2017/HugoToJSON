I'm now in the final stretch of my internship -- I've got a little over eleven weeks left at Hope Church and a to do list that's longer than [Snake Way](https://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Snake_Way). Before the academic year is out, and I move on to wherever I might go, I've got two trips in the summer to look forward to, a mission trip to Romania as well as a week spent at Soul Survivor Momentum.

What comes after that is mostly unknown. I'm applying to Moorlands Theological College to do a three year degree in theology but what shape that takes is currently undecided. My work on [Rock RMS](https://rockrms.com) over the past few months has got me itching to launch some form of consultancy business but I'm not sure I'll have room to explore that until the Summer hits.
