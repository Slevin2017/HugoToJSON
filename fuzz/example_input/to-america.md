I'm so excited. I'm headed to Peoria in October for RX 2015 - the first annual Rock RMS conference.

Up until three weeks ago I'd written off the prospect of me going. The cost of flights, a hotel, and conference entry totalled up was in the region of Â£1200, a seemingly insurmountable amount of money. Still, I mentioned the idea to my Dad and he suggested that if I had the opportunity to go that I should grab it.
