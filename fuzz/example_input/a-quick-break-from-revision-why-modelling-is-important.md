Looking at this blog title you might think I'm joking 'How is discussing requirements modeling a break from revision?'. Allow me to explain.

I took a break from revision to write an additional data select field (children's parents' email addresses) in Rock, what I thought was a quick and easy job. In truth, it kind of was. I'd already produced a data select like that before and I had a quick and dirty version working in under 15 minutes. Awesome!
