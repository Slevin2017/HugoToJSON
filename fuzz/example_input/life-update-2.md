The last blog post I wrote was a few months back in the midst of exam season. A lot has happened since then!

I started and completed an Undergraduate Research Project at Royal Holloway to provide a Web Service for ExpoSE.js, a tool for JavaScript testing. During which I learnt Rust, Angular 1, and got to tackle some really cool problems. I even submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/Samsung/jalangi2/pull/97) to a Samsung repo!
