My friends and I regularly hang out to watch movies but with such a large movie collection and so many of us making suggestions it can be difficult to pick what to watch. I built [Jonathan's Movies](https://github.com/arranf/jonathans-movies-client) to help make that process easier, hosts set up a poll - either with a round of nominations or a selection of options chosen by the host, and the users vote of the selection of movies.

The app is split into a Vue SPA client-side and a FeathersJS server backed by MongoDB. Both come with some interesting functionality.
