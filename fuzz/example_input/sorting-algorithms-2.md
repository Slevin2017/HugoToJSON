Sorting algorithms are kind of useful. There isn't a 'best' algorithm but there are a variety of algorithms that each have a merit in a given situation. They solve the problem of ordering a list of objects or values.

This blog post is going to explore the different algorithms and I'll write a simple Java program for each to demonstrate how they work.
