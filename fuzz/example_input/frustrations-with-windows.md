My desktop PC is a mini-ITX built with dual boot in mind however several months down the line I'm still only running Windows 7. All of the PC's parts are OSX compatible except for two, the graphics card (which I've yet to upgrade) and the wireless card. In today's day and age a computer without the internet isn't really a computer so I recently bought a replacement wireless card with the intention of installing it and then immediately going to dual boot.

Unfortunately, things aren't that simple. The current wireless card is attached to the motherboard with minute screws. Complicating the issue is the fact that my case is on the unusual end of the spectrum and takes every liberty to squeeze out space in order to be as true to the mini-ITX label as it can making it difficult to gain access to the screws.
