I'm taking a break from a marathon of password changes. I use [Lastpass](https://lastpass.com/f?408496)[^n] to manage my passwords. It stores my usernames and passwords and helps me generate new secure ones whenever I change my password or sign up for a new site. It also has a handy feature called the **Lastpass Security Challenge** which analyses your passwords (~740 odd in my case) and checks for duplicates, old passwords, and compromised passwords.

I'm pretty sure every single one of my passwords fell into one of those categories. Motivated by fear, I've been on a password changing frenzy. Lastpass is very good and for a number of sites automates the process. Unfortunately for me I hang around in some of the more obscure parts of the web and so have been changing passwords manually and in the process have a few complaints about websites and how they handle user accounts.
