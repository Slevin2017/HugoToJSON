**Note**: This was written a while back but I only just got around to publishing it.

So I've had a fairly inadequate router for a while. There were no advanced configuration options to speed up gaming, block adverts, or anything similar. I put up with it mainly because of the expense of replacing it but also because of the knowledge that DD-WRT (custom router firmware) might just be on the horizon. I'd Google every now and then, perhaps once a year, to see if anyone had managed to get it working never with any luck.
