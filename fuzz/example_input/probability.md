Probability is about events. Events are the outcomes of processes and can either be certain, impossible, or random. The set of all possible outcomes of a process is known as the **sample space**. Note that not all events need to have the same probability.

A probability function *p* for a sample space S {s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, s<sub>3</sub>, ..,s<sub>n</sub>} is p:S â†’ [0,1] such that p(s<sub>1</sub>) + p(s<sub>2</sub>) + p(s<sub>3</sub>) + .. + p(s<sub>n</sub>) = 1.
