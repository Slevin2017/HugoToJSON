Despite being fully invested in the idea of blogging, in reality I've been very inconsistent. If anything chronicles my life, it's certainly not this blog. My posts are fairly sparsely distanced and my Twitter and Instagram feeds are a lot more active. For some people, a Twitter or Instagram feed would be a sensible alternative to a blog but I don't feel the same way.

I believe in "long-form", relatively speaking, and I believe that the process of blogging is an important one. Twitter and Instagram capture a reaction at a given moment but a blog post captures a much more mature perspective - one who's age is measured in days not seconds.
