Joel and I spent the Summer of second year playing The Witcher 1: Enhanced Edition, a game I've wanted to play since 2007. This year we've decided to pick up The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings, the game [famously presented to Obama by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk](https://en.cdprojektred.com/news/the-witcher-2-presented-to-president-barack-obama/), and I intend to blog my thoughts and feelings about each chapter of the game. **WARNING: THIS SERIES WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS THROUGHOUT**
