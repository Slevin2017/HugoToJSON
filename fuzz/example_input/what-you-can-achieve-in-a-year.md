Jon Edmiston, one of my mentors and friends, has a phrase he frequently likes to use: "People overestimate what they can achieve in a day, but underestimate what they can achieve in a year[^1]. Like many of his sayings, it's one that's been repeated to me a lot but until recently I hadn't really reflected on it what it actually means.

Whilst the specifics of the phrase itself are immaterial I think it captures the reality that consistency achieves more than pure effort. Today I found an illustrative example of this doing some digital housecleaning. I manage my collection of RSS feeds using [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) and whilst I started with the intention of keeping an orderly collection of feeds over time their organisation has tended toward chaotic. I spent some time today to organise and curate the set of blogs I follow and as I did I noticed that a large percentage of the blogs I follow had ceased to be active some time ago and another large proportion of them only had a handful of posts each year.
