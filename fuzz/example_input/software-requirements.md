As we explored in my blog post on the [Software Engineering Life Cycle](https://blog.arranfrance.com/software-engineering-processes/) an essential part of any software engineering process is eliciting, understanding, and translating the requirements of your client. This is part of the analysis stage of software development and is a foundation for the entire project. Poorly understood requirements are likely to lead to a product that does not meet the client's expectations whereas well understood requirements minimise the amount of time spent clarifying leading to a faster development process.
