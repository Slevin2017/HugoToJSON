Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a behemoth of a game and with epic scale comes the challenge of complexity. Fantasy Flight, to their credit, have done a decent job of making the game digestable with the tutorial mission and the two rules books: the Learn to Play guide and the Rules Reference booklet. Shut Up and Sit Down have a [fantastic getting started video](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/videos/how-to-play-imperial-assaults-campaign/) to bring new players up to speed as well.

Still, despite the quality of resources it's easy to forget the odd rule here or there and so as an exercise I figured I'd do a deep dive into the manuals and collect up some of the rules that tend to be forgotten or mis-interpreted.
