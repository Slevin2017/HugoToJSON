I've been a Dallas Cowboys fan for the past three years. I fell in love with the team playing Madden NFL '11 on the Xbox throwing vertical passes to Miles Austin and clinching close games with Hail Marys.

Since then I've seen the Cowboys come close and fall at the final obstacle twice. Their 2012 and 2013 seasons both ended at the hands of a divisional rival on their sixteenth game leaving them with an 8-8 record.
