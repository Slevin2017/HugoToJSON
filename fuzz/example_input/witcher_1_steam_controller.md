My friend Joel and I have been playing through CD Projekt Red's original Witcher game for a month or so now by sitting in front of my PC with a mouse and keyboard. Now I've moved in with Catherine I wanted to take advantage of the sofa, my larger TV, and my [Steam Link](https://blog.arranfrance.com/post/thoughts-on-my-steam-link/). As an older game The Witcher doesn't work out of the box with anything other than a keyboard and mouse by default but fortunately the Steam Controller is capable of remapping itself to correspond to mouse and keyboard controls. 

I found this fantastic [set of bindings by Jason Andersen](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BxH0gPnw7U__aE83dDA4aUVsSmc?tid=0BxH0gPnw7U__NWtmSWlOOW1Gd3c) which take advantage of the controllers touch menus and it honestly feels easier to control in combat than using the standard keyboard and mouse bindings.
