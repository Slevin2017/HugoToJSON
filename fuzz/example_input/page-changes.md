When I created the [Ideal Postcodes plugin](https://github.com/arranf/IdealPostcodesLocationService) for Rock I realised that there was no reliable way of keeping up to date with changes to the Ideal Postcodes API. There's no RSS option, no email newsletter, and their Twitter feed would be easy to miss and is inconsistent anyway.

They have one key page on their website that lists all the major changes to their API. After a bit of Googling I discovered a service that monitors pages for changes which then alerts you via RSS, perfect!
