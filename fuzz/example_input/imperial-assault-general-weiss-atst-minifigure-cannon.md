I'm a huge fan of Star Wars and board game and so when I first heard about Star Wars Imperial Assault, I was hooked on the idea. A vast campaign featuring an array of beloved heroes and villains that punctuate your own narrative in the Star Wars universe. I held out for a week before I purchased the base game which comes with a huge number of mini-figures, none of which is more exciting than the _massive_ AT-ST, which dwarfs the other miniatures by comparison. In fact the AT-ST is so bewilderingly big (relatively speaking) it requires assembly -- the source of this blog post's problem. While the majority of the AT-ST assembly is straightforward its front facing cannon was a huge pain to attach. After purchasing the base game, no matter how much or how hard I tried I couldn't get the blasted cannon to fit into its slot. After trying to fit the thing in at the start of a couple of campaign sessions and following a couple of punt attempts by my friends, I resigned myself to having a less threatening cannonless AT-ST and threw the cannon attachment in the box and forgot about it.
