In preparation for my new working from home reigeme I spent a lot of time looking for a new keyboard. I knew I wanted a mechanical keyboard, known for their robustness and customisability, and I ultimately settled on a [TADA68](http://keyboardcatalog.com/65-percent/tada68).

The TADA68 hit a number of my key wants including customisable mechanical switches, [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) firmware to reprogram the keyboard, and a small 65% profile. Most important of all the TADA68 is [available in the standard UK (ISO) layout](https://kbdfans.cn/products/tada68-mechanical-keyboard-65-iso-layout) unlike most other mechanical keyboards which are only available in the US (ANSI) standard.
