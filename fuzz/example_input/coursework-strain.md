The past few months I've had a crazy work ethic -- one that's probably borderline dangerous. I've put in a lot of hours past five, worked on weekends, and even on days "off". That workload though is finally starting to pay off and settle down. 

The past week I've been sat in front of my computer typing up coursework in a last ditch effort to get my first batch of assignments completed before the (slightly extended) deadline. Today I'm rushing off to Northampton to hand those in.
