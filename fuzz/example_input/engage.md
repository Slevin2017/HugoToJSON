In my second year of internship my church sponsored me to take part in the CYM Engage course, a level three qualification in Youth Work. Doing so enabled me to justify spending another year as an intern as it offered me some concrete training and something formal to demonstrate to future employers.

Despite appearing on paper to be a positive thing in reality Engage was perhaps the most difficult element of my past year. Although I'd only been distanced from formal education for a year I found there was a significant drop off in my academic ability (not that I was the most studious student to begin with) and from the outset it was clear that the course demanded a lot more of my time than I had expected to need to give it.
