More geeky posts incoming, I'm afraid. It's revision season and this year I'm trying a new approach to my learning where I synthesise a topic and then blog about it to reinforce my understanding.

You can look forward to maths based posts about: the fundamentals of computers including number representation, logical propositions, boolean algebra, logic and switching circuits, finite state automata, and regular expressions; mathematical structures including sets, relations, functions, induction and recursion, algorithms, discrete graphs, vectors, vector space, and linear transformations; and probability and distributions.
