Today I learnt about the magic powers of `<sub>` and `<sup>` tags. If you're trying to express things in super or sub script outside of a powerful text editor it can be a pain. For me at least it involves trying to Google to find the correct character to copy or resorting to Windows Character Map, ugh.

Today I stumbled across [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_subscripts_and_superscripts) that describes the use of the `<sub>` and `<sup>` tags to express things in subscript and superscript, pretty much everywhere.
