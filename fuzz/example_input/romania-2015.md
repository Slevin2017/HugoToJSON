This is an incredibly late update on an even more incredible adventure.

In the first week of August I spent a week in Romania on a trip that, if I'm honest; prior, during, and after departure I was not looking forward to. The temperature was forecast for 35 degrees, I was already stressed out and emotional, and on top of it all I somehow had to magic an evening's youth service out of my brain and onto paper in the spare moments I could salvage from the day of our flight.
