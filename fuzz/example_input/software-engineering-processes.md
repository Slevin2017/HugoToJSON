## The Concept

The basic premise of all software engineering processes is that software is **large** and **complicated**. To tackle engineering any software the basic paradigm is to take the problem, abstract it decompose it into smaller sub-problems and then engineer software made up of small components to produce a system that solves the problem - analysis and synthesis. Easy, right?
