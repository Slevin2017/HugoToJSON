This afternoon I read a [blog post](https://roguecarl.blogspot.co.uk/) written by my friend Carl on the subject of his childhood hero Action Man.

If you were to ask anyone who knows me well if I was an "Action Man Boy" they would probably tell you I wasn't -- and they wouldn't be wrong. To be honest Action Man left very little of an impression on me, the toys were always a tad too expensive and on the whole something about his hyper masculinity never quite appealed to my geeky younger self. Preteen me preferred his heroes to use their brain rather than their brawn and so buff characters like Action Man were shunted in favour of the wiser Obi-Wan Kenobi and the more inventive Harry Potter.
