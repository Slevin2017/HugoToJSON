Last week I had the majority of my hair shaved off. I went from a guy with a fairly untidy amount of hair to a man with very little on his scalp in just under five minutes. 

It's all in the aid of a trip to Romania to visit the Corabia Foundation. For my shearing I've raised enough to pay for my flight to spend over a week working with the young people there.
