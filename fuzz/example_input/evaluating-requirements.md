# Reviewing Requirements
Why review requirements? Well poorly specified requirements are a huge source of faults in projects. Reviewing requirements gives you a chance to prevent these faults which propagate through the process. The more 'upstream' a fault occurs the more collateral has to be dealt with and consequently the more expensive fixing the fault is.
