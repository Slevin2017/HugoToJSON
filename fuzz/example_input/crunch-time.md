I've spent a long time today reflecting on what I'd like to do. As much as I love God I feel like now isn't the right time in life to be pursuing a theology degree. I haven't been excited by the prospect and I've been dragging my feet for a long time on it.

What excites me is developing, expanding, and innovating. I want to build a competent and effective church with a vision for transforming people's lives. What enthused me about the idea of studying at Moorland's was the concept of studying one day a week and spending five days a week in an environment where I could make my mark.
