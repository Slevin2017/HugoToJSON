This year we've decided to pick up The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings, the game [famously presented to Obama by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk](https://en.cdprojektred.com/news/the-witcher-2-presented-to-president-barack-obama/), and I intend to blog my thoughts and feelings about each chapter of the game. **WARNING: THIS SERIES WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS THROUGHOUT**\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\nLet's start at the very beginning, before Chapter 1 even begins.\n\n# The Intro Cinematic\n\nOne of the things clear from the get go with the Witcher 2 is that the quality bar has been moved up a notch. The first instalment of The Witcher could be summarised as 'Great ideas, poor execution.' and it's clear from the opening cinematic that CD Projekt RED have come leaps and bounds since then. The game's [opening cinematic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ_KtvVvolY) is perhaps one of the finest in gaming. It tracks the game's villain, Letho as he assassinates ... a king. Combining equal doses of suspense and spectacle, the cinematic has near-infinite re-watchability and serves as a strong opening blow for the game.\n\n{{< picture caption=\"The opening cinematic makes

begins the real stage setting. The game opens with Geralt in chains and a new character Vernon Roche pressing him for questions. The prologue follows a 'story within a story' model and as you converse with Roche flashbacks unlock gameplay. It's intriguing and at times a tad disorienting but as the story unfolds it increasingly feels epic in proportions.\n\nYou start out being (re)introduced to the character of Triss, who lies naked in the bed beside you, and the concept of Geralt's memory loss. Then King Foltest summons you to assist him in his siege of La Valettes castle as his personal body guard, a siege fuelled by a lover's feud. Whilst Foltest in his previous incarnation appeared weak and at times dispassionately detached from the worries of Vizima, this sequence of gameplay portrays him as a father on the front-line of a battle desperately seeking to recapture his children from their mother. Whilst the combat is unchallenging, even in the sections without AI support, and the puzzle sections border on inane, the storytelling is rich and engaging enough to make the prologue stand out.\n\nOf particular note is the first meaningful choice of the game - how to deal with Aryan La Valette, a stoic noble fighting for his family's honour in the face of overwhelming odds. The right conversation options enable you to persuade him to lay down his arms and unlock a new path in the conclusion of the prologue. Figuring out the tactic to persuading him feels rewarding, and doubly so at the end of the prologue.\n\n{{< picture caption=\"The prologue's dragon feels like a teaser, I'm sure we'll see them again\"

hinted at in early dialogue options, that accelerates the pace of the game and leads you directly to the cut-scene of Foltest being reunited with his children, and his assassination. A nasty twist that is telegraphed too heavily by the scenes with Roche, but is still rewarding enough due to the quality of the set piece. Here, the game relies heavily on the dialogue wheel both to drive the gameplay, a welcome change of pace from the early chore of combat, and to drive the narrative. The prison break that ensues whilst a predictable trope isn't entirely without depth for those who spared Aryan La Valette as he reappears and in a last act of honour blows up the prison during your escape.\n\nAs Geralt, Roche, and Triss escape on the boat the prologue ends and chapter one begins. It's a strong opening to the title and it acts as a highlight reel showing off all the compelling elements of The Witcher in a short and perfectly paced introduction. Whilst it would be easy to draw comparisons to the Witcher 1's Kaer Morhen prologue it's evident that the sequels take on the opening act is far stronger."},{"title":"Thoughts On My Steam Link","tags":["gaming"],"href":"/post/thoughts-on-my-steam-link","content":"Moving in with Catherine has prompted a number of changes, the main being that my computer could no longer be the focal point of the room. Instead, it's relegated to the back corner of the living room which is absolutely fine for development work but less than ideal for gaming with friends.\n\nGiven that most of the gaming my friends and I do is through Steam I figured I'd give a [Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/353380/Steam_Link/) a whirl and for £12 it didn't seem like a bad deal. My main concern with the purchase was performance, reviews suggest it has minimal latency over a wired connection (in the region of 1-4 ms) but performs less optimally on a wireless connection. Our rented flat doesn't have any cable runs anywhere so I was going to have to either endure performance degradation using wireless or find some creative way to connect the Steam Link to my computer.\n\nAfter a bit of investigation I discovered that the Steam Link [works fine directly connected to my PC](https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/0/610574827761790871/) meaning I only needed a single long Ethernet cable (carefully snaked behind a sofa and book case) rather than connecting them via my router which would need at least two more garish Ethernet cables as well as some way of securing them over the top of the door.\n\nInitial setup wasn't fantastic, and I struggled for over an hour to connect my Steam controller to the Steam Link. [Rumour had it](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/3z6x80/psa_you_dont_need_to_plug_in_the_steam_controller/) that you could pair your Steam Controller directly with the Link but I also wanted to preserve my pairing with my computer using the dongle. After a little bit of searching I found an article in [Steam's Knowledge Base about doing exactly that](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9772-WHJM-4676) the trick is to press `A  +  Home` when connecting to switch between the pairings.\n\nEven after correctly pairing the controller it failed to work once streaming began, after a lot of troubleshooting I realised that the Steam Link's software was incredibly out of date (build 213) and that it would be unable to update if it was solely connected to my PC. After connecting it to my Wi-Fi and a long update process (~15 minutes) I had a working Steam Link and Steam Controller!\n\nAfter testing a few games it performs reasonably well, I was able to play Rocket League without feeling disadvantaged and single player games play great as well. I can definitely foresee myself playing more games now I have a comfortable sofa to play them from."},{"title":"Moving to Hugo from Ghost","tags":[],"href":"/post/moving-to-hugo-from-ghost","content":"# Why Move?\nOne of the biggest difficulties with maintaining a blog, aside from writing it, has been 'Where do I keep it?'. In fact, [my very first blog post](https://blog.arranfrance.com/post/blog-quandaries/) is a rather confusing and contradictory read in which I describe this very problem.\n\nRecently I decided to jump ship from a Ghost instance hosted on $5/month Digital Ocean droplet. There are a few reasons I made this decision but the primary factor was *things kept breaking*.\n\nOn the first of August I was sat in Heathrow airport with a few hours to kill so I decided to hash out a quick blog post describing my Summer's experience doing an Undergraduate Research Project. I quickly realised that my Ghost version was already about 4 minor versions out of date, that image upload was broken, and that my private key to SSH in to try and fix anything was on my Windows partition. It was all just *too* much hassle. I love the Ghost project and ideally would have loved to keep using the platform but self hosting wasn't working and the $5/mo cost for a blog I don't use all that often didn't seem that worth it, and so the $30/mo cost for Ghost Pro certainly wasn't going to be an option.\n\nAbout a month ago I stumbled across [this article](https://koz.io/ghost-to-hugo/) in which the author outlines a similar set of frustrations with maintaining a Digital Ocean droplet for Ghost and describes how they switched to Hugo, intrigued by the prospect of not having to maintain a server as my content would be primarily static I thought I'd give it a go and I've been very happy with the results.\n\nMy process wasn't quite the same as the authors so I thought I'd outline the process I followed.\n\n# The Process\n\n1. I grabbed a copy of the my `ghost/content` folder which contained my themes, images, etc. To do this, I used rsync.`rsync -a username@remote_host:/var/www/ghost/content ~/Downloads``\n2. Using the [Ghost export tool](https://docs.ghost.org/faq/the-importer/#imports-in-ghost) I grabbed a JSON copy of my posts.\n3. I created a new Hugo site. The process wasn't too hard. I grabbed the latest Hugo release from Github (I found that `sudo apt-get install hugo` was out of date). There isn't a lot to Hugo's command line,`hugo new blog` creates a new Hugo site called blog.\n4. I moved the Ghost `images` directory to `blog/static/`\n5. To convert my Ghost data to Hugo posts I found this [fantastic Python script](https://cowboyprogrammer.org/2016/07/migrating_from_ghost_to_hugo/). To use it save the Python as something like `ghosttohugo.py`, `chmod +x ghosttohugo.py`, and run `.\\ghosttohugo.py -f YOURGHOSTEXPORT.json -d ~/path/to/hugo/blog` I ran into an error with it unable to find files when I first ran this. I fixed it by making a posts directory inside `blog/content`.\n6. At this point I needed a theme. It doesn't really matter which theme you pick there are [tons of good ones](https://themes.gohugo.io/). I picked [hemingway](https://github.com/tanksuzuki/hemingway). Whichever you pick I recommend adding it as a submodule  in your `blog\\themes`directory `git submodule add https://github.com/arranf/hemingway.git`.\n7. To get a look at how things looked I used `hugo server` which is a pretty nifty command to generate your site and see what it looks like.\n8. At this point I realised my favicon was the default hugo one so I copied all my favicons to `blog/static`\n9. All that was left was to build my site using the `hugo` command and host it somewhere. I tried [staticland](https://static.land) and [surge.sh](https://surge.sh) before settling on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). I couldn't get staticland to work and surge.sh was asking for too much per month for a SSL with the static site. Netlify seems to fit my needs pretty well right now. Of course you can host easily using either GitHub or GitLab pages!"},{"title":"Replacing Cat with Bat","tags":["Rust","Bash","Cat","Unix"],"href":"/post/rust-alternatives-to-command-line-utilites-bat-cat","content":"Any frequent user of a Unix operating system will find themselves using the same command line utilities over and over again: rm, mv, ls, cp, grep, and cat to name a handful.\n\nA lot of these utilities are old and are written in C. C is a great language for high performance work but it's long in the tooth and it's speed often comes at the cost of reliability and/or security. Of course, whilst classic Unix utilities like cat are battle tested they are often difficult to change. Decades old codebases aren't the easiest thing to work with and doing so in a way that is backwards compatible and with the same level of assurance of reliability isn't trivial. Thankfully [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) provides a solution - a language with safety and performance at it's heart.\n\nRecently I stumbled across a 'rustified' version of cat - [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat). Bat is a true cat replacement that also includes syntax highlighting, Git integration, and automatic piping to less - awesome!\n\nInstallation was easy and I took the liberty to add an alias so I wouldn't forget it existed.\n\n```bash\nsudo dpkg -i bat_0.9.0_amd64.deb\necho \"alias cat='bat'\" > ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```"},{"title":"Building a Rust Utility: Hugo Static Blog to Lunr Index","tags":["Hugo","Blog","Rust","Lunr"],"href":"/post/building-rust-utility-hugo-to-lunr-json","content":"Rust is a language which has fascinated me since I was first introduced to it at the [end of my first year of undergraduate](https://blog.arranfrance.com/post/summer-2016/). Since then Rust has evolved at a frantic pace and I feel like I've forgotten a lot of the subtleties of Rust syntax so I've decided to do a number of small projects in Rust to brush up.\n\nThe first project I've tackled is replacing an outdated an abandoned npm package, [hugo-lunr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hugo-lunr). This blog's search is powered by Lunr which requires an array of JS objects containing information about each post. `hugo-lunr` is designed to run during the site's build step to produce the static index by iterating over Hugo markdown files and extracting key information from the front matter and dumping the contents to a JSON file which can be retrieved and consumed by Lunr at runtime. Unfortunately `hugo-lunr` is a fairly bare-bones implementation with a number of open pull requests and issues making it an excellent candidate for replacement.\n\n# Version 0.1\n\nThe [initial version of my efforts can be found here](https://github.com/arranf/HugoLunr/). Most of the complications fell into one of two camps: Strings and file access. Rust has [a whole section of its book dedicated to Strings](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std/str.html) and it's easy to see why. Rust's borrow checker makes typically simple operations, like concatenating strings, difficult. I ended up using a pattern I found in [a repository that benchmarks string concatenation](https://github.com/hoodie/concatenation_benchmarks-rs) `[[FORWARD_SLASH, &directory, FORWARD_SLASH, slug].join(EMPTY_STRING);]` as a workaround in that case but I lost a lot of time figuring out how to manage the lifetime of borrowed string slices from a file access. In the end the only mechanism I could find was to turn them into heap allocated strings.\n\nFile access was a little easier to reason about but still not straightforward. Initially I expected there to be a standard library function for recursive traversal but instead I had to settle on [an external dependency](https://github.com/BurntSushi/walkdir) for the task. Rust's Path struct also leaves a lot to be desired, getting the path for the directory of a file requires a bizarre function invocation\n\n```rust\nPath::new(&config.index_path).with_file_name(EMPTY_STRING)\n```\n\nThe standard `fs::write()` call also fails to write if there is a subdirectory missing in the path. Whilst these are small annoyances, there were enough of these idiosyncrasies for me to have an exceedingly large number of Rust doc tabs open by the time I finished the first version.\n\nWhilst frustrating at times, the experience as a whole has been positive. The program runs _fast_ and the code is easy to read. Additionally, I'm loving the [Option module](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/) and the neat ways it allows you to deal with errors that arise.\n\n# Areas for Improvement\n\nThe first point of call will be to improve the argument parsing logic to allow for optional arguments and help text. I also intend to support features requests from `hugo-lunr` such as the ability to include drafts and exclude certain child directories. I also want to include support for JSON and YAML front matter. Eventually I also intend to allow for configuration to be loaded from a file rather than command line arguments.\n\n# Use in Build Step\nThis blog is built and deployed by Netlify so I needed a way to run my new Rust utility on Netlify. Historically `hugo-lunr` would be fetched from NPM by Yarn and run using Grunt. Initially I considered wrapping my utility in a Node container and uploading it to NPM but that seemed like far too much effort. Instead, I was inspired by [GoDownloader](https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader) - I fetch the latest version of the utility from Github releases using a simple bash script.\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\n\n# Get latest HugoLunr release\nLATEST_RELEASE=$(curl -L -s -H 'Accept: application/json' https://github.com/arranf/HugoLunr/releases/latest)\n\n# The releases are returned in the format {\"id\":3622206,\"tag_name\":\"hello-1.0.0.11\",...}, we have to extract the tag_name.\nLATEST_VERSION=$(echo $LATEST_RELEASE | sed -e 's/.*\"tag_name\":\"\\([^\"]*\\)\".*/\\1/')\nARTIFACT_URL=\"https://github.com/arranf/HugoLunr/releases/download/$LATEST_VERSION/hugo_lunr\"\nINSTALL_DIRECTORY=\".\"\nINSTALL_NAME=\"hugo_lunr\"\nDOWNLOAD_FILE=\"$INSTALL_DIRECTORY/$INSTALL_NAME\"\n\n echo \"Fetching $ARTIFACT_URL..\"\nif test -x \"$(command -v curl)\"; then\n    code=$(curl -s -w '%{http_code}' -L \"$ARTIFACT_URL\" -o \"$DOWNLOAD_FILE\")\nelif test -x \"$(command -v wget)\"; then\n    code=$(wget -q -O \"$DOWNLOAD_FILE\" --server-response \"$ARTIFACT_URL\" 2>&1 | awk '/^  HTTP/{print $2}' | tail -1)\nelse\n    echo \"Neither curl nor wget was available to perform http requests.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ \"$code\" != 200 ]; then\n    echo \"Request failed with code $code\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nchmod +x \"$DOWNLOAD_FILE\"\n./\"$DOWNLOAD_FILE\"\n```"},{"title":"Board Gaming and Me","tags":["board-games"],"href":"/post/board-gaming-and-me","content":"Playing and collecting board (and card) games is one of my favourite hobbies. For the vast majority of people, 'board game' is synonymous with Monopoly, Risk, and Cluedo but in 2012 my eyes were opened to a much more satisfying understanding of the term.\n\nMy journey started when I asked Reddit for suggestions on how best to tackle introducing my girlfriend at the time, who wasn't particularly socially confident, to my family. A number of responses suggested board games as an easy way to break the ice and forwarded me to [/r/boardgames](https://reddit.com/r/boardgames). There I discovered a host of games that went beyond the typical circus of family classics that are dusted off each Christmas and I became immediately hooked on the concept; investing the majority of my Christmas money on some of the recommended and popular games at the time.\n\nIt wasn't until I stumbled across a Rock Paper Shotgun article on The Fantasy Flight game *Descent* that I realised the depth and breath of what board gaming had to offer. The article described a ongoing quest of heroes, across several lengthy sessions where both the heroes and the opposing villain and his minions were controlled by players. I immediately pitched the idea to my friends, who were mildly interested. The game had recently stopped being printed but I managed to secure a copy, and several of the expansions online. I was overwhelmingly impressed with the *scale*, the monsters were large and frightening, the maps were made up of interlocking tiles, the campaigns had multiple possible bad guys, there was any number of possible quests, you could upgrade gear and abilities - the game had depth and replayability and unlike any video game I got to play with people across the table from me.\n\nMy love affair with board games hit a winter period following the conclusion of school, and with it my Descent campaign, as friends moved away and life grew busy with other things but this wasn't to be the end of my love affair with my favourite cardboard pastime. I played a game of Forbidden Island with my friend Dan Hawksley and he quickly became a fan of the art amassing a large collection and connecting with a number of local players. Board games became a staple in his household and during the remainder of my time in Corby I massively enjoyed playing with him and his family.\n\nMoving to university, my schedule again became dictated by other priorities leaving little time for board games but during my breaks from term and visits the Hawksley family would always play a game or two with me keeping my interest in the hobby. Until a combination of recent events this Summer spurred a personal renaissance. After spending much of the exam period reminiscing about my time playing TCGs I got a chance to play Star Wars: The Card Game, a fun two player card game - which prompted me to invest in the similarly styled Android: Netrunner. I also heard about Star Wars Imperial Assault a Descent-esque Rebels vs Imperial campaign. These two purchases have reignited my passion for the hobby and over the holiday season I purchased a few more to add to my collection. It's been amazing sharing games with my university friends and in a subtle way they've helped me realised just how important those friendships are."},{"title":"Firebase Databases and Vue","tags":["firebase","vue.js","patterns"],"href":"/post/firebase-databases-and-vue-patterns","content":"One of the key principles of software engineering is DRY, or in long form: Do Not Repeat Yourself. It's a principle that prevents errors, reduces the size of your code, and makes refactoring easier. In near direct opposition to this is the poor standard of coding on the web. Tutorials are full of examples that encourage you to do exactly the opposite, to repeat yourself, and given the scarcity of good example architectures it's easy to fall into bad habits.\n\nI've currently got a small Vue.JS side project I'm using to test out various technologies, a small notes web app. I originally wrote it to test out VueX, a state library for Vue, but I'm in the process of refactoring it to use Firebase to persistently store notes and to authenticate users.\n\nA number of tutorials have had trouble with the concept of a global instance of the firebase database object. I've seen it stored within the VueX store (which causes mutations not caused by actions, clutters your store, and makes it unecessarily hard to access it) and I've also seen it created once (or more!) per route. Both of these patterns are abusing the intent of the object.\n\nHere's a much simpler pattern:\n\n**firebase.config.js**\n``` js\nimport Firebase from 'firebase'\nconst config = {\n    apiKey: \"<API_KEY>\",\n    authDomain: \"<PROJECT_ID>.firebaseapp.com\",\n    databaseURL: \"https://<DATABASE_NAME>.firebaseio.com\",\n    storageBucket: \"<BUCKET>.appspot.com\",\n    messagingSenderId: \"<SENDER_ID>\",\n  }\nexport const firebaseApp = Firebase.initializeApp(config)\nexport const database = firebaseApp.database()\n```\n\n**MyComponent.vue**\n``` vue\n<script>\nimport { database } from './firebase.config'\n\nexport default {\n  firebase {\n    example: database.ref('items')\n  }\n}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis takes advantage of ES6 classes. The creation of database occurs exactly once when the module is first loaded and then the same object is made available to all other imports of database. This prevents you unnecessarily committing your database to VueX and the bad code smell of repeated instantiation."},{"title":"Online TCGs: Hearthstone vs Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links","tags":["Games","Hearthstone","Duel Links"],"href":"/post/online-tcgs-hearthstone-duel-links","content":"For years, going back to my childhood, I've dabbled in various competitive card games - most consistently Yu-Gi-Oh! but also Pokemon, Netrunner, Magic the Gathering, and Mojang's Scrolls. When a friend introduced me to [Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.konami.duellinks&hl=en_GB) I couldn't resist.\n\nThe premise is pretty simple, your starting character is one of the two main characters from the original TV series - (Yami) Yugi or Seto Kaiba; and your aim is to rise to the top of Duel Links tournament which pits the best duelists in the world against each other. You have a starting deck based on your character's deck from the original series and you battle other duelists to gain experience points in order to level up your character, which unlocks skills and new cards for your deck. Separate from your character's level there are 'stages' of the game which can be progressed through by competing various challenges, such as 'Win 5 duels' or 'Use 10 trap cards'. Completing stages unlocks additional characters from the TV show such as Joey Wheeler, who can be battled against or played as. Although a tad cheesy the game's theme is actually one of its strengths, the setting is familiar and embedded deep in the heart of the game without being overbearing or annoying.\n\nIn fact Duel Links' _feel_ is polished to near perfection. Moments like pulling a rare card from a pack or summoning a signature card have dazzling animations to accompany them and moments of dialogue between rival characters are nostalgic and true to the game's source material. Even the mechanism used to encounter duelists in the 'Duel World' feels like it was designed to deliberately feel like you're part of a city wide tournament. Unfortunately, whilst the experience of playing captures the TV show, creating a deck doesn't feel anything like playing the physical TCG.\n\nDuel Links' central, and fatal, flaw is the difficulty of constructing a good deck. In the game there are three methods for obtaining cards. Buying packs from the shop, trading with the card trader, and beating duelists. Each of which is worse than the last. The shop is potentially the least offensive. It offers a stock of several types of pack, each with a different variety of cards in it and before purchase you're able to know which cards are left in the box and their rarity. Each pack costs 50 gems (which equates to roughly 30-60 mins of play) and offers three cards. The main issue is of course, getting the *right* cards. Packs are designed in such a way there's a mixture of useful and useless cards and for most players each kind of pack will have only a handful of cards you want. The card trader is even worse, he deals in an entirely separate currency of gold, stones, and other unique objects which are obtained unreliably as random drops from duelists in duel world or by converting cards into stones. His stock rotates daily making acquiring cards from him more a matter of good fortune rather than strategy. Duelists drops are the worst of all, all duelists offer a large pool of cards they might drop which are a mixture of a generic shared pool of low level monsters and other ineffective cards and the cards unique to them reducing the chances of getting a good card to near nil. The inability to reliably obtain cards hamstrings everyone's ability to build a good deck resulting in duels where whoever can get the biggest beatstick on the field first wins. As much as I long to build a fantastic Amazoness deck the reality is it'd take me hundreds of hours of grinding.\n\nAfter investing a week of my life playing Duel Links I'm left feeling pretty disappointed. There's so much promise here and I *want* it to be good. Concepts like the Vagabond, a unique duelist that challenges you with a handicap in exchange for higher XP, and the worldwide events draw me in - but no matter how much I steel myself to play it, I'm always left with a sour taste in my mouth after I open a pack.\n\nFrustrated by Duel Links I decided to try out Hearthstone, Blizzard's online TCG. Immediately I became aware of just how polished the Duel Links Android app is. My first few attempts to play Hearthstone were ruined by strange signup flow errors and the tutorial experience left a lot to be desired. In fact, the whole Hearthstone mobile client runs pretty poorly. That said the game does have an innate charm. The music, the small interactions on the game boards, the unique voice lines given to heroes and cards create a fantastic depth of experience that [intentionally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7ZLJZIXSfc) form the basis for a surprisingly deep card game.\n\nWhilst I was initially spurred on to try Hearthstone on the basis of economy, it turns out Hearthstone is just as guilty in this arena. There are a few [easy ways to get initial packs](/post/hearthstone-beginner-packs/) but for the most part you're stuck paying 100 gold per pack and earning gold at the rate of 50-60 per day. Whilst a pack gives you a good number of cards, Hearthstone's power level is really built around legendary cards - cards that drop with a frequency of roughly 1 in 20. Getting a good collection is an expensive and long process. That said, it's one I somewhat ashamedly have to admit I took part in. \n\nThe basis of Hearthstone's economy is probably its only souring point. The gameplay itself is rewarding in a way that most other card games fail to match. Blizzard take full advantage of the digital nature of the game in its card design, frequently producing gems like [Nozdormu](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/285-nozdormu), [Yogg-Saron](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/33168-yogg-saron-hopes-end), and [Elise](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/55451-elise-the-trailblazer) that simply wouldn't work in a physical card game. Whilst game balance is never quite perfect in Hearthstone the revolving door of the 'standard' mode and the semi-frequent balance patches feel like a cleaner solution than errata or ban lists ever did.\n\nIn short, whilst Duel Links might have the more absorbing meta-game, when it comes to playing the card game itself Hearthstone is ahead of the curve."},{"title":"Ruby on Rails Naming Conventions","tags":["ruby","code-standards","code-conventions","rails","databases"],"href":"/post/ruby-rails-naming-conventions","content":"Today I started a new project to create an Amazon-esque system for sharing lists of gifts a person might like with their faily.

I knew I wanted a mechanical keyboard, known for their robustness and customisability, and I ultimately settled on a [TADA68](http://keyboardcatalog.com/65-percent/tada68).\n\nThe TADA68 hit a number of my key wants including customisable mechanical switches, [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) firmware to reprogram the keyboard, and a small 65% profile. Most important of all the TADA68 is [available in the standard UK (ISO) layout](https://kbdfans.cn/products/tada68-mechanical-keyboard-65-iso-layout) unlike most other mechanical keyboards which are only available in the US (ANSI) standard.\n\nI noticed during my first day using the TADA68 that the key that represents the backslash and pipe symbol wasn't working. I decided to take the opportunity to play around with QMK to change the layout to suit my needs a little better. I initially tried to use the online [QMK config tool](https://config.qmk.fm/#/) to generate a layout, which surprisingly supports the TADA68 ISO layout. As the QMK config tool only produces `.hex` files and the TADA68 [requires a `.bin` file to update its firmware](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0267/1905/files/TATA68-Manual-1.pdf) I used the hex2bin utility to convert it.\n\nUnfortunately, after flashing my new layout my `#` stoped working. I also tried building the ISO-UK layout in the [QMK repository](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) and flashing the layout from there with the same effect. To test if my `#` switch had bit the dust during some part of the flashing process I added a new function to the `tada68.c` file\n\n```c\nbool process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {\n    xprintf(\"KL: row: %u, column: %u, pressed: %u\\n\", record->event.key.col, record->event.key.row, record->event.pressed);\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\nThis function prints to debug the row and column of the physical key switch that is being pressed (as opposed to the keycode which is controlled by the QMK firmware layout). After connecting up the keyboard to the [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox) I realised that the key switch underneath my  `#` key is connected to a pin in the  13<sup>th</sup> column of the PCB, despite other switches in that column of the keyboard  being associated with the 12<sup>th</sup>. To fix this I [forked](https://github.com/arranf/qmk) the QMK repository and adjusted the ISO layout in `tada68.h` and `keymap.c`.\n\n`tada68.h`\n```c\n#define LAYOUT_iso( \\\n    k00, k01, k02, k03, k04, k05, k06, k07, k08, k09, k0a, k0b, k0c, k0d, k0e, \\\n    k10, k11, k12, k13, k14, k15, k16, k17, k18, k19, k1a, k1b, k1c, k1d,  k1e, \\\n    k20, k21, k22, k23, k24, k25, k26, k27, k28, k29, k2a, k2b,      k2d, k2e, \\\n    k30, k31, k32, k33, k34, k35, k36, k37, k38, k39, k3a, k3b, k3c, k3d, k3e, \\\n    k40, k41, k42,           k45,                k49, k4a, k4b, k4c, k4d, k4e  \\\n) \\\n{ \\\n    {k00, k01, k02, k03, k04, k05, k06, k07, k08, k09, k0a, k0b, k0c, k0d, k0e}, \\\n    {k10, k11, k12, k13, k14, k15, k16, k17, k18, k19, k1a, k1b, k1c, k1d, k1e}, \\\n    {k20, k21, k22, k23, k24, k25, k26, k27, k28, k29, k2a, k2b, XXX, k2d, k2e}, \\\n    {k30, k31, k32, k33, k34, k35, k36, k37, k38, k39, k3a, k3b, k3c, k3d, k3e}, \\\n    {k40, k41, k42, XXX, XXX, k45, XXX, XXX, XXX, k49, k4a, k4b, k4c, k4d, k4e}  \\\n}\n```\n\n`keymap.c`\n```c\nconst uint16_t PROGMEM keymaps[][MATRIX_ROWS][MATRIX_COLS] = {\n  /* Keymap _BL: (Base Layer) Default Layer\n   * ,----------------------------------------------------------------.\n   * |Esc | 1|  2|  3|  4|  5|  6|  7|  8|  9|  0|  -|  =|Backsp |~ ` |\n   * |----------------------------------------------------------------|\n   * |Tab  |  Q|  W|  E|  R|  T|  Y|  U|  I|  O|  P|  [|  ]|  #  |Del |\n   * |-------------------------------------------------------    -----|\n   * |CAPS   |  A|  S|  D|  F|  G|  H|  J|  K|  L|  ;| '|  |Entr|PgUp|\n   * |----------------------------------------------------------------|\n   * |Shift|  \\ |  Z|  X|  C|  V|  B|  N|  M|  ,|  .| /|Rshift|Up|PgDn|\n   * |----------------------------------------------------------------|\n   * |Ctrl|Win |Alt |        Space          |Alt| FN|Ctrl|Lef|Dow|Rig |\n   * `----------------------------------------------------------------'\n   */\n  [_BL] = LAYOUT_iso(\n    KC_ESC,  KC_1,    KC_2,    KC_3,    KC_4,    KC_5,    KC_6,    KC_7,    KC_8,    KC_9,    KC_0,    KC_MINS, KC_EQL,  KC_BSPC, KC_GRV,  \\\n    KC_TAB,  KC_Q,    KC_W,    KC_E,    KC_R,    KC_T,    KC_Y,    KC_U,    KC_I,    KC_O,    KC_P,    KC_LBRC, KC_RBRC,  KC_NONUS_HASH, KC_DEL,  \\\n    KC_CAPS, KC_A,    KC_S,    KC_D,    KC_F,    KC_G,    KC_H,    KC_J,    KC_K,    KC_L,    KC_SCLN, KC_QUOT,           KC_ENT,  KC_PGUP, \\\n    KC_LSFT, KC_NUBS, KC_Z,    KC_X,    KC_C,    KC_V,    KC_B,    KC_N,    KC_M,    KC_COMM, KC_DOT,  KC_SLSH, KC_RSFT, KC_UP,   KC_PGDN, \\\n    KC_LCTL, KC_LGUI, KC_LALT,                   KC_SPC,                             KC_RALT, MO(_FL), KC_RCTL, KC_LEFT, KC_DOWN, KC_RGHT\n\t),\n\n  /* Keymap _FL1: Function Layer 1\n   * ,----------------------------------------------------------------.\n   * |   | F1| F2| F3| F4| F5| F6| F7| F8| F9|F10|F11|F12| Delete| Ins|\n   * |----------------------------------------------------------------|\n   * |     |   | ↑ |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |     |Home|\n   * |-------------------------------------------------------    -----|\n   * |       | ← | ↓ | → |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  |   |    | End|\n   * |----------------------------------------------------------------|\n   * |     |   |   |   | L+|LED| L-|   | V+|  V-|Mut|  | MsBtn|Up|MsBn|\n   * |----------------------------------------------------------------|\n   * |    |    |    |                       |   |   |    | Lt| Dn| Rt |\n   * `----------------------------------------------------------------'\n   */\n  [_FL] = LAYOUT_iso(\n    _______, KC_F1,   KC_F2,   KC_F3,   KC_F4,   KC_F5,   KC_F6,   KC_F7,   KC_F8,   KC_F9,   KC_F10,  KC_F11,  KC_F12,  KC_DEL,  KC_INS,  \\\n    _______, _______, KC_UP,   _______, _______, _______, _______, _______, _______, _______, _______, _______, _______,  _______,  KC_HOME, \\\n    _______, KC_LEFT, KC_DOWN, KC_RGHT, _______, _______, _______, _______, _______, _______, _______, _______,           _______, KC_END,  \\\n    _______, _______, _______, _______, BL_DEC,  BL_TOGG, BL_INC,  _______, KC_VOLU, KC_VOLD, KC_MUTE, _______, KC_BTN1, KC_MS_U, KC_BTN2, \\\n    _______, _______, _______,                   _______,                            _______, _______, _______, KC_MS_L, KC_MS_D, KC_MS_R\n\t),\n};\n```"},{"title":"Test Hugo Lunr","tags":["a","b"],"href":"/post/a-b-c","content":"Short test\n<!--more-->\n\nmore test"},{"title":"SSH Tunnels to Complete an Assignment","tags":["ssh","unix"],"href":"/post//ssh-tunnel-to-complete-an-assignment","content":"Today I set out to tackle what appeared to be a simple Christmas assignment using JDBC to run a series of SQL commands on a remote database reading from some text files.

'What is Ngrok?' I hear you cry. Ngrok, is an infuriatingly useful tool - allow me to explain.\n\nThere are things known as 'webhooks', an address for a message to be sent to when an event occurs. When the message is sent to that address the webhook captures the message message and processes it in a useful way.\n\nFor instance, if you send email using a service like [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) there's an option to have events like emails being opened to a webhook. You can then take the message sent to that webhook and use it to store information about who opened it, when they opened it, and what email client they opened the email in.\n\nIf that sounds great to you, then it should. Webhooks are really useful. The issue comes when you are *testing* your webhook. The quickest way for testing an application you're writing is to write it on your computer and run it there too. How then, do you give a web address for your computer to the service that will call your webhook?\n\n## Enter Ngrok!\nNgrok, a tiny command line application, gives you the ability to temporarily give a specific port on your machine a web address. Now we can test our webhook!\n\nThe problem is that if you run Ngrok on Windows you'll often run into 404 errors. Fixing these in my past experience has involved a [whole heap of command line commands and editing your web server's config file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14881515/browse-web-site-with-ip-address-rather-than-localhost) - all very unpleasant, prone to error, and time consuming.\n\nThe error is caused because the hostname on the incoming request matches the web address given to you by Ngrok rather than your machine's local address.\n\n## Ngrok to the Rescue (Again)\nI recently learnt Ngrok has a command to fix this!\n``` cmd\nngrok.exe http -host-header=rewrite localhost:YOURLOCALPORT\n```\n\nThis command has saved me so much time over the past few weeks and turns webhook debugging into something I no longer fear.

Migrating email is hard, and will be the subject of another blog post I'm sure, but one specific area of difficulty was replacing every reference of arran@arranfrance.com in my code bases. A lot of these references are innocuous - for example author emails in `package.json` files, but a few are more important for example the email address listed in my CV. I wanted to catch them all in one fell swoop.\n\nMy code lives under a single directory called `~/projects`. Whilst existing Linux utilities can handle finding and replacing recursively (either `sed` or `awk` would have worked), having used them before they aren't the simplest of utilities to wrap your head around for this use case and I wanted something that would be easy for me to avoid making mistakes with. Enter [Amber](https://github.com/dalance/amber)! It made the whole process a breeze.\n\nFirst I had to install Amber which was straighforward. I grabbed the latest release from the Github releases page and then copied the `ambr` (search only) and `ambs` (search and replace) binaries to `/usr/bin`. Then finding and replacing all the instances of my previous email address with my new one was as simple as the following commands.\n\n```bash\ncd ~/projects\nambs arran@arranfrance.com arran@arranfrance.com\n```\n\nAll that was left to do afterwards was commit the changes.\n\nHow hard would this have been to do using the alternatives I mentioned above? Well this looks reasonably hard according to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1583219/how-to-do-a-recursive-find-replace-of-a-string-with-awk-or-sed). The top answer isn't portable due to `sed` differences on OSX, it fails on a git repositories as the replace doesn't ignore the `.git` folder, and the solution involves a complex chain of `xargs` and pipes. How does that compare to amber? Well amber is portable, it ignores VCS locations (.git, .hg, .svn, .bzr) by default, and it has a far more ergonomic user interface. I'm looking forward to finding more modern Rust utilities to add to my toolbox"},{"title":"Tracking Your eBay Global Shipping Programme Package","tags":["ebay","shipping"],"href":"/post/global-shipping-programme-tracking","content":"eBay offers its sellers a service to help them ship items internationally called the _Global Shipping Programme_ (GSP). In exchange for a cut of the item cost eBay handles the import and delivery of items through a chain of international contractors and GSP hubs. To say that the GSP has been unpopular would be an understatement, it has been heavily criticised for offering a poor service, slow delivery, and causing inflated prices. Ignorant of the disadvantages I ordered a board game from the states under the promise of not having to fork out an obscene amount for custom charges and safe in the knowledge that I could easily get a refund if something went wrong.\n\nIt turned out my biggest concern during the process would be figuring out when it would arrive. During it's stateside travels it was easy to track its journey, with regular updates from USPS all along the way from Indiana to the GSP headquarters in Kentucky. Once it departed the shores of the land of the free things got a little bit more tricky. I thought I'd share my experience to help other who are struggling to figure out where their package is.\n\nThe GSP uses multiple carriers and whilst you have a global tracking number, for instance mine was `UPAAA000000204998072`, it doesn't give you any granular information once the item has left the states. At this point you should switch to your secondary wNDirect tracking number (mine was `LPKEN000000233908905`), who are the service that transports the item internationally. Their tracking system messages require a bit of deciphering. One of my line items was `In transit AIRLINE:BA/FLIGHT:182/AWB:125-39469710` by Googling the airline and flight number I was able to determine when it had entered the UK. Another confusing tracking status was `In transit SCANNED TO CONTAINER`, which was the only information I had for five days. Confused by the lack of information, I reached out to wNDirect for some clarity via their executivesupport@wndirect.com email address. They responded quickly and informed me that the package was travelling through customs.\n\nAfter it has cleared customs wNDirect pass on the last mile delivery to 13ten, who again contract other couriers. The 13ten tracking site is the most terrible of them all but you can glean a bit more info than their site lets on. If you visit [https://13ten-tracking.citipost.co.uk/Home/History?order=YOURORDERNUMBER](https://13ten-tracking.citipost.co.uk/Home/History?order=XXXXXXXXXX) (my order number was `WNM0002276595`) you'll receive an XML document which contains both the courier (once pre-advice has loaded) and the tracking number. The courier is inside the `<carrier>` XML tag and the tracking number for that carrier is inside the `<jd>` XML tag. This allows you to visit the courier's website to at least get an indication of when the item is likely to be delivered. Although Hermes only appear to update their information once a day, 13ten take a further 8-12 hours to poll Hermes to update *their* tracking information."},{"title":"Documenting Bricks and Mortar Studio's Rock RMS Plugins","tags":["documentation","rock-rms","travis"],"href":"/post/documenting-bricks-and-mortar-studio-rock-rms-plugins","content":"A long time ago I spent a Christmas trying to figure out the best way to solve the problem of documenting my plugins for [Rock RMS](https://www.rockrms.com/). I'd decided I wanted each to have a standalone website and that I wanted them all to look and feel similar by using a common template. The documentation would live alongside the code by using Github Pages but I was still struggling with one problem - how do I update all of my plugins if the template changes? I solved the problem, but unfortunately and somewhat ironically I didn't document it at the time. So a year and a half later I'm revisiting the process to iron out and wrinkles and document the process.\n\n# The Big Picture\n\nThe big picture is this, each individual documentation website (served from Github Pages) consists only of the minimum number of files required, the rest uses a master Jekyll template which is pulled during the Travis CI build step. Any change to the master template is captured by a webhook running on Google App Engine which then triggers a Travis CI build of all documentation sites. \n\n![BricksDocumentationExplanation](/images/2017/Jun/BricksDocumentationExplanation.png)\n\n# The Template\n\n[The template](https://github.com/BricksandMortar/Vibranium) (and consequently the sites) are Jekyll based and use a mixture of JQuery, FontAwesome, raw CSS, Bootstrap, and other outdated web technologies. The template is loosely based off of Bootstrap 3's documentation. All in all it's pretty raw but does the job relatively well. \n\nThe template stores a copy of the build scripts, the Gem file, and boilerplate `_config.yml`.\n\n# Travis CI\n\nTravis CI combines the repo specific documentation files with the template.\n\n## Config\n\nJekyll is configured via `_config.yml` , stored in the template, which includes the boilerplate variables used in every documentation site and also placeholders for the plugin name and repo name which are replaced during the build step.\n\nTravis specific configuration is stored in the `.travis.yml` file found in the root of the plugin repository.  It specifies the branches that builds can be triggered from (just `pages-ci`), the variables for the name of the plugin and the name of the repo,  and an encrypted Travis variable for the Github Token (`GH_TOKEN=...`) used to push deploy to Github. For convenience you can fetch this from [travisencrypt.arranfrance.com](https://travisencrypt.arranfrance.com).\n\n## Build\n\nMost of the build process is stored in the scripts found in the template but the Travis file has the commands to fetch the main install script from the template repo via curl, make the necessary files executable, and run `deploy.sh`.\n\nThe main scripts of interest are `ciinstall.sh` which clones the template,  then copies the template on top of the Travis build folder, fetches the necessary Ruby gems, and runs `replace.py` to overwrite placeholder values in the Jekyll config file.\n\nThere are a couple of idiosyncrasies in order to serve the site both locally and on Github with minimal fuss. `deploy.sh` uses `sed` to replace `{{site.github.url}}` with `{{site.baseurl}}` . If this isn't done URLs all fail to point to the correct place either locally or when served via Github in production. I'm sure this is a terrible way of doing it but it works for the moment. There's an outstanding [issue](https://github.com/BricksandMortar/Vibranium/issues/1) to investigate it further.\n\nBefore deploying [html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) is run on the site to ensure there are no dead links. There's definitely room here to do some further testing (spell-checking as well as JS and CSS testing).\n\n# Plugin Site\n\nEach plugin site has a `page-ci` branch where all of the documentation specific files live, these are then built with the template, and pushed to the `gh-pages` branch - effectively deploying it. The plugin specific files are purely any additional assets required (typically images), `documentation/index.html`,  `index.html`, and `.travis.yml`. \n\n# Webhook\n\n[Ultron](https://github.com/BricksandMortar/Ultron) is a Python 2.7 webhook run on Google App Engine. It receives notifications when any repo from the BricksandMortar organisation is pushed to, a branch or tag is created or deleted, or a repo is created or deleted. It tracks repositories with `pages-ci` branches in a Google Cloud datastore. Whenever a push occurs to the template repo it triggers Travis CI builds on all of its tracked repositories. It is set up with Travis CI to auto-deploy to Google Compute on every push to the `master` branch.\n\nUltron is configured with  `config.py` which contains the secrets for Github and Travis, a `bricks-build-docs-...json` which contains the Google Cloud configuration, and an `app.yaml` which contains the Google App Engine configuration. As both `config.py` and `bricks-build-docs-...json` contain secrets they are stored in the repo as `secrets.tar.enc` and are unencrypted during the build step."},{"title":"Easy Beginner Hearthstone Packs","tags":["hearthstone"],"href":"/post/hearthstone-beginner-packs","content":"I've recently started playing [Hearthstone](https://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/), Blizzards online TCG. Coming late to the party (by roughly 3 years) I've been at a significant disadvantage not only due to my inexperience but also my rather small card collection. As a result, I've been determined to grab every free pack that's available and so I've put together this guide to help other new players in a similar position to me and I'll also touch on some great tips for new players not directly related to getting packs.\n\n# Starting Out\n\nAfter completing the tutorial you'll have a basic mage deck but much else. The next stop is to go to Practice Mode there you'll be able to grab five packs for winning five games. Keep playing the Mage until you get to level 10, as that'll net you another classic pack. Beating every hero in practice mode will get you 100 gold, the cost of a pack of your choice and will unlock the expert AI. \n\nBeating each of the expert AI is good for another 100 gold. It's worth doing this in one sitting by beating them down the list in order as there's no way to track which ones you've beaten or not. All of these are relatively straightforward to beat except the Warrior and Shaman. \n\nPlay mode is your final stop. Completing your first game (yep, conceding counts!) gets you one pack. Two more games after that gives you 100 gold.\n\nBy this point you should have three packs and 300 gold, enough for another three. That's good but there are much easier packs to get!\n\n# Promo Packs\n\nThere are packs available for playing a game on specific types of devices. In total there are **seven** classic packs available plus a unique card back. A pretty good deal! There is one pack available for playing a game on an iPad, Android Tablet, Android Phone, and iPhone and the additional three packs and card back are available for playing on a Samsung Galaxy S6 phone.\n\nYou might think you're out of luck if you don't have those devices but it is possible to fake being on them assuming you have either a Windows PC or a Android device using [these fake APKs and DLLs](https://yadi.sk/d/Spqeb6l8rHYGW). If you do use the DLLs on Windows don't forget to backup the DLL you're 'replacing'!\n\nThe Galaxy packs are obtainable by using [NOX](https://www.bignox.com). \n\nHere are the steps for doing so.\n\n1. Download, install, and run Nox.\n2. Go to System Settings -> Properties and change the following\n   1. Manufacturer to `samsung`\n   2. Model to `SM-G930A`\n   3. Brand to `SM-G930A`\n3. Restart NOX\n4. Download Hearthstone from the Play Store\n5. Log in with your account\n\n# Welcome Bundle\n\nAs a new player you're eligible for a special discount on packs. There's a welcome bundle with a guaranteed useful class legendary and 10 packs for the price of £4. That's some amazing value compared to normal pack prices and is well worth getting to start you off.\n\n# Keep Your Ear to the Ground\n\nIt's worth keeping a track of the [Hearthstone Blog](https://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/blog/) I've earned a number of packs by being aware of time sensitive promotions."},{"title":"Wrestling with Assembling the Star Wars Imperial AT-ST","tags":["star wars","imperial assault","minifigure","board games"],"href":"/post/star-wars-imperial-assault-at-st-general-weiss-minifigure-issue","content":"I'm a huge fan of Star Wars and board game and so when I first heard about Star Wars Imperial Assault, I was hooked on the idea. A vast campaign featuring an array of beloved heroes and villains that punctuate your own narrative in the Star Wars universe. I held out for a week before I purchased the base game which comes with a huge number of mini-figures, none of which is more exciting than the _massive_ AT-ST, which dwarfs the other miniatures by comparison. In fact the AT-ST is so bewilderingly big (relatively speaking) it requires assembly -- the source of this blog post's problem. While the majority of the AT-ST assembly is straightforward its front facing cannon was a huge pain to attach. After purchasing the base game, no matter how much or how hard I tried I couldn't get the blasted cannon to fit into its slot. After trying to fit the thing in at the start of a couple of campaign sessions and following a couple of punt attempts by my friends, I resigned myself to having a less threatening cannonless AT-ST and threw the cannon attachment in the box and forgot about it.\n\nThis Christmas, my buddy Joel bought me the General Weiss Villain pack as an addition to our game which comes with another AT-ST minifigure which had the same issue. We hazarded a guess that there was either a problem with the design of the minifigure or a problem with us. We Googled for an unboxing video and our hunch there was an issue [was confirmed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNo3UXcvZhs) by Saipher.\n\nOur solution to attaching the cannon differs from his. We didn't have a sharp enough knife on hand and his solution felt a little too heavy handed. By our reckoning, the cause of the issue is the two projections on either side of the inside of the cannon slot that are designed to fit into the dimples on either side of the cannon are too large making it impossible to push the cannon into the cannon slot. If you use a nail file to gently file down the two bumps on the inside of the slot your cannon should be able to fit into the slot and fix itself in place. You'll know when your cannon is secured as it makes a rather sharp snap sound.\n\nHopefully this helps you assemble either your AT-ST base figure or your General Weiss figure."},{"title":"Tokyo 2019 Booked","tags":["Holiday","Travel","Japan","2019","Tokyo"],"href":"/post/tokyo-2019-booked","content":"Joel and I have booked a trip to Tokyo this Summer.

I considered writing the whole website in regular plain HTML and CSS but I wanted some things to 'just work' like routing and a basic theme but the power to go 'under the hood' when needed to define a unique layout for the CV. I ended up settling on [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). VuePress comes with a great out of the box theme as well as the ability to write Vue components in markdown. For the CV page I defined a custom layout which contains multiple reusable components.\n\nI also adjusted this Hugo blog to match the same theme by converting the old [Hemingway theme](https://github.com/arranf/hemingway) I was using to use VuePress's default styling.

The old theme had a lot of dependencies which have been either been removed or upgraded and I also fixed the build process along the way. Overall, the blog looks a lot cleaner and I feel a lot more confident in its appearance and the structure of its layout."},{"title":"Fantasy Flight's Business Model: Why It Sucks For You and Me","tags":["board-games","fantasy-flight","imperial-assault"],"href":"/post/fantasy-flights-business-model","content":"Fantasy Flight Games make some outstanding board games. In fact half of my current collection are games published by them and every single one of them is a quality title. Equally Fantasy Flight know how to milk their games for maximum profit. They're in the business of expansion packs and episodic content, viewing their products as franchises rather than games and leaving players nickeled and dimed in their wake.\n\nA great example of Fantasy Flight's cash over consumer culture is Star Wars Imperial Assault and it's ally and villain packs. Rather than offering extras for purchase with the ally and villain packs Fantasy Flight is effectively stripping content from the core set and big box expansions and transplanting them into separate blister packaging. Nowhere is this more evident than in the base Imperial Assault box where Luke and Vader, and their corresponding missions and agendas, are packaged separately as ally and villain packs hinting at their near exclusion and a last minute audible, probably because of the menacing and otherwise misleading image of Vader on the box's artwork. Unfortunately, despite as a similar depiction on the box art of the Twin Shadows expansion, Boba Fett wasn't so lucky and didn't escape the villain pack fate. As a result he's only included as a token in the Twin Shadows expansion and you have to buy his miniature and additional missions separately.\n\nRepackaging these well loved characters in a game primarily about an untold Star Wars story wouldn't bother me as much if it wasn't for the game's skirmish mode. Often touted as the hidden gem of Imperial Assault and proclaimed by Fantasy Flight as the second of the \"two games in one box\", skirmish is a fully realised and free standing game with a competitive tournament scene. Like all competitive games, there is a meta-game and certain characters and combinations offer a significant advantage, requiring players to purchase specific ally and villain packs to maintain a competitive edge. Furthermore, according to Fantasy Flight rules you're unable to play tournament skirmish matches with tokens forcing players to purchase ally and villain packs for characters that were already included 'in the box'. I understand that miniatures require a significant cost to produce it somewhat justifying their separate purchase but it feels like Fantasy Flight has rigged the table in favour of their wallets, at this point the ally and villain packs aren't an upgrade for those with cash to spare - they're an integral part of Imperial Assault if you want to play the second game in your core box. Whilst I don't *mind* spending a little extra to have a rich universe to play in, and heck £7 for Chewbacca is worth it, at the time of writing Imperial Assault has 34 expansions, across both big box and character packs. That's a lot to buy.\n\nDon't get me wrong expansions are great, they offer a fantastic way to expand on a gaming experience you love and Fantasy Flight do know how to release games that I enjoy. And to a certain extent I don't even mind buying a *lot* of expansions if they offer value. When I do get upset is when they're unavailable. Fantasy Flight produces so much physical content that it's borderline unsustainable. To combat this, rather than continually producing games they do irregular print runs. Over time, as purchases happen, stocks dwindle across retailers and suppliers worldwide to the point that games and expansions become unavailable until the next print run. This isn't just obscure add-ons like ally and villain packs either, it's true of base games and big box expansions. At this point, you might think, 'Well that's not so bad. Fantasy Flight will just print it again!', and that's mostly true but the question is, 'When?'. Based off of my experience, retailers don't know.\n\nYesterday I tried to purchase some of the expansions for Star Wars Imperial Assault and every main retailer in the UK was out of stock and none of them could tell me when they'd have stock back in. Unwilling to pay the price of the secondary market, I spent hours trawling through pages of Google searching for hobby shops and visiting websites of obscure regional retailers trying to piece together an order from multiple retailers across different countries to get all of the expansions I wanted.\n\nFantasy Flight can do better, and they should too. It'd take a culture shift but swapping their tactics to offer better value expansions, genuinely optional extras, and a more transparent print timeline for retailers would make for a much healthier relationship between publisher, retailer, and consumer."}]
